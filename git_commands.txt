  project

11. git status
* compares your repository to the files you are working on; tells you 
  if you have made any changes but haven't added or commited them yet.
  git is not able to keep track of files you haven't added or commited.

12. GIT WORKFLOW
	
	working copy > staging area > repository
	* when file is created > when file is git added > when file is commited

13. git add filename.format
* if you want to add a specific file to the staging area

14.git log -number --oneline
* gives you the previous "number" (you specified) of commits made in one line each.
  short form; cos logs are otherwise detailed

15. git diff
* tells you the difference between file in repository to working copy

16. git diff --staged
* tells you the difference between file in repository and staging area

17. git mv filename.format newfilename.format
* way of renaming file

18. git commit -am "message"
* way to bypass the staging area. lets you commit the changes directly.
  so from working copy to repository in one go. grabs everything from 
  working copy to repository. use it with caution. only when you are sure
  of all the changes you want to commit.

19. git checkout -- filename.format
* takes something from the repository and make it the working copy. 
  in case you mess up the working copy. undo changes you make in the
  working copy and get the good files from the repository.

20. git reset HEAD filename.format
* to take a file from the staging area (after having run the command git
  add .), back to the working copy. Basically, unstaging the file.
